# Film Wallpapers
#My wallpapers I use, predominantly just screenshots from movies. I believe this all falls under fair use, if you own the rights to any of these images and want them removed, just message me and I'll happily oblige. 

#Wallpapers will be organized by catagories of desending aspect ratio; further catagorized by film. Afterwards, they will be ordered by the number added by me, not chronological order.
#16:9 Triple Widescreen - Groups of 3 wallpapers that work well for a triple monitor set up; pay attention to groups of 3, eg: (1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9)
#21:9 (Ultra)Widescreen - Wallpapers in the 21:9 Aspect Ratio
#16:9 Widescreen - Normal 16:9 wallpapers
#4:3 Fullscreen - S Î© U L

#Do not expect this to get updated any time soon. The only film I have immediate acess to in passable quality is The End of Evangelion, along with the complementary anime series.
